    "modification": "modify: I have replaced the generic `Custom` operator with the more specialized `AnswerGenerate` operator. This change is designed to improve the model's reasoning by explicitly forcing a step-by-step thought process, as described by the operator. The graph now calls `answer_generate` and returns the 'answer' field from its output. This modification directly targets the reasoning failures and contradictions between the thought process and the final answer observed in the provided error logs.",
